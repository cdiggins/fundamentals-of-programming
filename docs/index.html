    <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
    <p>
      Programming is the act of performing computation (computing values) and automation 
      (telling computers and robots to do things) with code.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the Fundamental Parts of Code?</h2>
    <p>
      The key components of code are:  
      <ul>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Expressions</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Data Types</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>What is an Expression?</h2>
    <p>
      An expression (also called a term) is either a literal value (e.g., the number 42), or a reference to a variable (e.g. x),  an operator 
      ("+") applied to one or more sub-expressions, or a function call (e.g., f(x)).
