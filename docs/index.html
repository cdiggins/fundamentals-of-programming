    <h1>The Fundamentals of Programming</h1>
    <p>
      This web-site is dedicated to helping people learn and teach the fundamental concepts of programming using JavaScript
      and graphics.

    <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
    <p>
      Programming is the act of performing computation (computing values) and automation 
      (telling computers and robots to do things) with code.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the Fundamental Parts of Code?</h2>
    <p>
      The key components of code are:  
      <ul>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Expressions</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Data Types</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>What is an Expression?</h2>
    <p>
      An expression is either a literal value (e.g., the number 42), a reference to a variable (e.g. x), an operator 
      ("+") applied to one or more sub-expressions, or a function call (e.g., f(x)). 
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Variable and a Value?</h2>
    <p>
      A variable is a name that is associated with a value. A value is a piece of data that the computer program is tracking at 
      run-time. It might be a number or a string, or an aggregation of multiple values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables can be associated with (assigned) new values. If a variable is assigned a value
      when it is created, this is called "initialization".
